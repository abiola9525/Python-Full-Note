'''A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory.
It is helpful to think of variables as a container that holds data that can be changed later in the program.
'''

#For example

number = 24     #Here, we have created a variable named number. We have assigned the value 24 to the variable.

print(number)
# # Declaring and assigning value to a variable
# website = "plitsolutions.com"
#
# print(website)

# Changing the value of a variable

name = "Python"
print(name)

name = "pygame"         # Assign a new value to name
print(name)

# Assigning multiple values to multiple variables

a, b, c = "python", 3.2, "Hello"

print (a)
print (b)
print (c)

# If we want to assign the same value to multiple variables at once, we can do this as:

x = y = z = 56

print (x)
print (y)
print (z)
# #
# #         # CONSTANT
# # A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.
# # It is helpful to think of constants as containers that hold information which cannot be changed later.
#

# '''
#         Rules guiding variable namimg
# 1. Constant and variable names should have a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_). For example:
first1name1 = "John"
print(first1name1)
#         snake_case
#         MACRO_CASE
#         camelCase
#         CapWords
#
# 2. Create a name that makes sense. For example, vowel makes more sense than v.
#
# 3. If you want to create a variable name having two words, use underscore to separate them. For example:
#         my_name
#         current_salary
#
# 3. Use capital letters possible to declare a constant. For example:
#         PI
#         G
#         MASS
#         SPEED_OF_LIGHT
#         TEMP
#
# 4. Never use special symbols like !, @, #, $, %, etc.
#
# 5. Don't start a variable name with a digit.
